**Datasets Used:**  
- RAVDESS
- CREMA-D
- TESS
- SAVEE

**Approach:**  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained using features like MFCC, Chroma, MelSpectrogram, and others. The model was evaluated for accuracy in detecting emotions based on the audio inputs.

### Virtual Try-On - README

**Objective:**  
This part of the test explores the creation of a virtual try-on system focused on Pakistani cultural dresses. The idea is to allow users to experience traditional outfits for events like weddings and Eid virtually.

**Key Features:**
- **Cultural Customization:** Users can select outfits based on Pakistani regions (Punjabi, Sindhi, etc.) and events.
- **Social Integration:** Allows users to share try-on results with friends.

This report is part of an aptitude test to demonstrate the planning and use of existing technologies for virtual try-on applications.
